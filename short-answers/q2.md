# Question
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer
Both `.then` and `.catch` are JavaScript methods that take callbacks as arguments.

    `.then` runs when a promise is successfully resolved; the resolved value is passed as an argument into the callback provided to `.then`.

    `.catch` runs when a promise is rejected; the rejected value (error) is passed as an argument into the callback provided to `.catch`.
