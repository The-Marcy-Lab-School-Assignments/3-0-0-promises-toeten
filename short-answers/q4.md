# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
The arguments passed into `resolve/reject` handle the promise, determining the outcome of the promise. When you pass an argument to `resolve`, the promise is fulfilled. When you pass an argument to `reject`, the promise is rejected.
